# hello-world
This will be a practice to get familiar with the tools of this site
Hi Humans, 
My name is Rebekah, and I am excited to start a digital history course to hopefully learn how to intergrate more technology into my research. 
I also study Russian language and literature which I found to be like a puzzle.
I believe I will find interacting with these new tools to also be like a puzzle.
